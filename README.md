# Everyone is Yelling!

An academic exploration of developing software using Test Driven Development (TDD). 

Used the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle to develop the app and its corresponding automated test stuite..

* **Programming Language**: Java
* **Testing Framework**: JUnit (can be adapted to any xUnit framework)

## Code Samples

* Source code: https://github.com/joaorebelo92/Yelling-App/blob/master/test/YellingTest.java
* Automated JUnit test cases: https://github.com/joaorebelo92/Yelling-App/blob/master/test/YellingTest.java

## Expected Output

* All requirements are implemented
* All requirements have corresponding unit test cases
* All requirements pass

## Program Description

The Yelling App is an app that helps college professors reduce blood pressure by yelling.

**Function prototype**: `String scream(String name)`

## List of requirements

* R1: Write a function accepts a single name as input.  Function should output "[name] is yelling"
* R2: If name is null, function outputs "Nobody is yelling"
* R3: If name is uppercase, function outputs "[NAME] IS YELLING!"
* R4: Given an array of 2 names, function outputs "[name1] and [name] are yelling!"
* R5: Given an array of more than 2 names, function outputs "[name1], [name2], and [name3] are yelling!"
* R6: Given an array of 3 names (uppercase and lowercase mixed), function outputs: "[mame1] and [name2] are yelling. SO IS [NAME3]!
